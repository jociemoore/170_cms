# Content Management System

This is a basic CMS, which stores content in the filesystem instead of a database. I used this project to practice implementing features based on high-level requirements, working with the Ruby File and IO classes, converting markdown to HTML with Redcarpet, testing a Sinatra app with the Rack library, and considering security issues.
