Ruby 2.4.0 Released

Improve the internal structure of hash table (st_table) by introducing open addressing and an inclusion order array. 

Binding#irb: Start a REPL session similar to binding.pry

Unify Fixnum and Bignum into Integer

String supports Unicode case mappings


Performance improvements:
[x, y].max and [x, y].min are optimized to not create a temporary array under certain conditions.

Added Regexp#match?, which executes a regexp match without creating a back reference object and changing $~ to reduce object allocation.


Debugging: 
Thread#report_on_exception and Thread.report_on_exception

Thread deadlock detection now shows threads with their backtrace and dependency
